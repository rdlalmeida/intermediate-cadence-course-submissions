Q1. In the very last transaction of the Using Private Capabilities section in today's lesson, there was this line:

```cadence
// Borrow the capability
let minter = &ExampleNFT.NFTMinter = minterCapability.borrow() ?? panic("The capability is no longer valid.")
```
Explain in what scenario this would panic.

This code panics if the owner(administrator) of the ExampleNFT.NFTMinter resource decides to invalidate the Capability (unlink it from the private storage path) that was, at some point, deposited by himself to the Minter Proxy source that the current user has access. Once the Capability is unlinked, its path now points to a nil value, which is what it is going to be returned by the borrow above, which in turn triggers the panic statement.

Q2. Explain two reasons why passing around a private capability to a resource you own is different from simply giving users a resource to store in their account.

R1 - By keeping a resource "useless", as the case of the MinterProxy Resource considered which gets its NFT minter initialized as nil, one retains control of who can use the resource as it was intended. If the Capability necessary to make the resource work was kept in a public storage path instead, anyone could generate the missing element. But if it is stored in its private counterpart, only the user that can access this storage can produce the Capability required.

R2 - Storing Capabilities in private storage paths also allows the owner to control future usage of the resource because he's able to revoke its "usefulness" by unlinking the Capability from the private storage path. This type of revoke control can disappear easily if the public storage path is used to link the Capability instead. Any user can borrow it at will and activate as many minting resources (going back to the example considered). True, the owner can unlink it from the public storage path to stop the uncontrolled minting from that point onwards, but he cannot do anything to any resources generated by any user up to there.

Q3. Write (in words) a scenario where you would use private capabilities. It cannot be the same NFT example we saw today.

Humm, though one given that Cadence is all about NFTs...
Imagine a blockchain-based RPG game where a character can be represented by a resource (essentially is a NFT but this is not the main point of the example). Like all RPGs, characters gain experience as they progress in the game and kill stuff left and right. Eventually the character gains enough EXP to raise its level and with that ascension the player can choose one of several paths regarding the character evolution (choose an Agility, Strength or Magic build for example) but only one per level up.
One way to implement this mechanic is to protect the
