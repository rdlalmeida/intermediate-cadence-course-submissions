            If this is the case, I need to "rebuild" the link. First, borrow a reference to the Resource in storage and validate that it is indeed of the required type
            There are two ways to ensure the correct type is present in Storage:
                1. I can borrow a Reference from storage while indicating the specific type that needs to be returned, i.e., RicardoCoin.Vault. I can set a panic
                    in that borrow call. Specifying the type implies that if a Resource with a different type is that storage path instead, a nil is returned by the
                    borrow function and the panic is raised.
                2. I can borrow the reference without specifying the Type and afterwards do a comparisson with the getType() function for the resource retrieved.

                Option 1 is the most practical one in this context and therefore is the one to be used.
            
            NOTE: A panic in the next instruction can mean one of two things:
                1. There is some other Resource stored in the oficial path but its not a RicardoCoin.Vault
                2. There's nothing stored yet in that path
            
            In either case I should panic because I don't what the script to continue
